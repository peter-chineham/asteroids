# Asteroids
This project is based on the 1979 Atari arcade space shooter game Asteroids. In the original game, the player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. 

This version includes only the spaceship and the asteroids, but has much better graphics than the original – and can be made using resources already in Scratch! The player controls a spaceship which moves around deep space dodging the asteroids coming from all directions. Each asteroid destroyed earns a point. The asteroids move in random directions – then disappear. The game ends when an asteroid collides with the spaceship.

The following parameters will be used to change how the game behaves:
•	How quickly the spacecraft speeds up when the rocket engine is fired (thrust)
•	How quickly it slows down when the rocket engine is off (friction)
•	How far the laser gun will reach (max_laser)
•	How many asteroids can be visible at the same time (max_rocks)
•	How close to the spaceship new asteroids can appear (min_distance)
